This task is to create a login form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form asks the user to enter their name, date of birth, email ID, and password. CSS is used to give a simple and neat appearance to the form.

JavaScript is used to check the entered details when the user clicks the login button. It verifies whether all the fields are filled correctly, checks the email format, and ensures that the password has the required length. If any detail is missing or incorrect, an error message is shown on the screen. If all details are correct, a success message is displayed.

This task helps in understanding basic form validation, DOM manipulation, and user input handling in web development.# jstask1
